# AndroidRetrofit

A very simple form of retrofit example for GET and Post Request from a spring boot server connected with mysql database.

If you want to use this example then change the localhost with your ip. For example, mine is 192.xxx.xx.x so you can check by using command 
ipconfig and take the wifi ipv4 address.

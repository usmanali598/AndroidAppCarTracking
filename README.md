# AndroidRetrofit

A very simple form of retrofit sometry for GET and Post Request from a spring boot server connected with mysql database.

If you want to use this sometry then change the localhost with your ip. For sometry, mine is 192.xxx.xx.x so you can check by using command
ipconfig and take the wifi ipv4 address.
